# Module Name
Hello Hackers

## Challenge Name
In this challenge, to get the flag, you must run the hello command (NOT the echo command) with a single argument of hackers. 

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{kn0yEFpIpp6d8C7Ys7Jyt3p401h.QX4YjM1wiMyEzNzEzW}`

type in your solve and your thought process behind solving the challenge. Include as much as info as possible. Use triple ticks for any bash commands and output you type on the terminal.

```bash
echo Hello Hackers
hello hackers
pwn.college{kn0yEFpIpp6d8C7Ys7Jyt3p401h.QX4YjM1wiMyEzNzEzW}
```

### New Learnings
I have learned that echo is a shell command which is used to print text.
Also here the argument is case sensitive so the argument given should be in lower case ex:hackers.

### References 
None.
