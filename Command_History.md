## Challenge Name
You can scroll through those saved commands with the up/down arrow keys, and we'll practice that in this challenge. This challenge will inject the flag into your history.

### Solve
**Flag:** `pwn.college{YKcHy6rXp1WoMsbve2Opj1AOCNj.0lNzEzNxwiMyEzNzEzW}`

```bash
history
    1  hello
    2  echo Hello Hackers
    3  Hello Hackers
    4  hello Hackers
    5  hello hackers
    6  the flag is pwn.college{YKcHy6rXp1WoMsbve2Opj1AOCNj.0lNzEzNxwiMyEzNzEzW}
    7  history
pwn.college{YKcHy6rXp1WoMsbve2Opj1AOCNj.0lNzEzNxwiMyEzNzEzW}
